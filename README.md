# AirReserve (Winner of Best Usage of Tavily API + Best UI Interface)

An intelligent flight booking and price tracking application that combines real-time web crawling and ambient AI agents to provide a seamless and affordable travel planning experience for everyone.

## Overview

AirReserve is a flight search and booking platform that uses AI-based solutions to provide users with real-time flight data, intelligent price monitoring, and an intuitive booking interface.

## Key Features

### Intelligent Flight Search
- **Real-time data crawling** using Tavily API to fetch live flight prices from multiple sources
- **Natural language processing** for intuitive search queries
- **Smart filtering and sorting** based on user preferences
- **Price comparison** across multiple airlines and booking platforms

### Powered by Ambient AI Agents
- **Background monitoring** ambient agents built with Langchain
- **Automated price tracking** without user intervention
- **Intelligent notifications** when price thresholds are met
- **Continuous learning** from user behavior and preferences

### Advanced Integrations
- **Firebase backend** for real-time data synchronization
- **MCP (Media Control Protocol)** integration for enhanced agent communication
- **External API orchestration** for comprehensive data aggregation

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- Modern React-based UI framework

### Backend
- **Python 3.8+** - Core backend language
- **FastAPI** - High-performance web framework
- **LangChain** - AI agent framework and orchestration
- **LangGraph** - Advanced agent workflow management
- **Tavily API** - Real-time web crawling and data extraction

### Data & Infrastructure
- **Firebase** - Real-time database and authentication
- **MCP Protocol** - Media Control Protocol for agent communication
- **Node.js** - JavaScript runtime for build tools
- **Express.js** - Web server framework

## Architecture

### Ambient AI Agent System
The application features a sophisticated ambient agent that runs in the background, continuously monitoring flight prices and market conditions. This agent:
- Operates autonomously without constant user input
- Learns from user preferences and search patterns
- Provides proactive notifications and recommendations
- Maintains context across multiple user sessions

### Real-time Data Pipeline
```
Tavily API → Data Processing → LangChain Agent → Firebase → React UI
```

### MCP Integration
The Media Control Protocol integration enables:
- Seamless communication between different agent components
- Standardized data exchange protocols
- Enhanced reliability and error handling
- Scalable agent architecture
